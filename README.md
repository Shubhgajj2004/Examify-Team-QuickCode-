- Nowadays, cheating is easy thanks to the Internet. But stop no more.

- Searching on Google or WhatsApp groups via minimizing exam-conducting apps has become commonplace. But what if you can't do it?

- As teachers already monitor your hand movements, taking another mobile might be difficult;

- In this way, Examify meets teachers' needs.ðŸ˜€


## Features

- Students can easily keep track of all upcoming exams, including their time, type, chapters, and date, by using an easy-to-use app.
- The teacher can conduct two types of exam

    1.)Simple Exam

    2.)Secure Exam


```
1.)Simple Exam - Helps teachers to upload all exam details with instructions. Exam papers are only accessible when the exam actually begins, and students submit their answers then.
```

```
2.)Secure Exam - Helps teachers to take exams cheating-free. Access to the exam is only possible with an ExamID. As soon as a student leaves the exam to cheat, the paper is automatically submitted, and the student can no longer enter the exam again.
